#First Post

This is my first post, in what i am hoping to be many, in my journey to learn the Rust programming language.

This dev log has been written in Rust as my first small project. With my learnings so far being:
* installing Rust
* cargo new/build/run
* cargo dependencies
* basic Rust syntax
