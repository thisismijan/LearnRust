# Advent of code 2023
<br>

I know i said in the last post I was going to start on the Rustlings problems but [**Advent of code 2023**](https://adventofcode.com) is starting tomorrow and I think that it's the perfect opportunity to practice and grow my Rust. I will create a new project and will be working on that for the next 25 days.<br>  
Catch you tomorrow
