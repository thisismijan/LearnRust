# Drawing the board
<br>

I am going to preface this by noting that I am not a front end dev and developing UIs is not my forte.<br>  
Damn, this ward difficult. I googled how to draw a frontend in Rust and was bombarded with all of the competing frameworks, the GUI isn't even that important to me, I just wanted something that would work.<br>  
Ended up going for winit and probably will evolve to e-gui framework which can be used with WebAssembly, so hoping a smooth solution to getting on a web page. And it took me ages to get it working. Rust is a fairly new language and a lot of the crates are being constantly updated, with breaking changes too, so it ends up being quite difficult to find a tutorial. But you know what they say, read the docs, and lo and behold I got it to work. I now have a chess board, in all its brown glory.<br>  
I think I am going to take a bit of a break from the chess projects and go through the [**Rustlings**](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) problems, to get more of a better handle around the language and so when I do hit something I don't know I am not running around like a headless chicken as I was trying to get this GUI running. I will be pushing my solutions to the problems on my github,
