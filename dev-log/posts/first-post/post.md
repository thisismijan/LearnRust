# First Post

<br>  

This is my first post, in what i am hoping to be many, in my journey to learn the Rust programming language.<br>  
This dev log has been written in Rust as my first [**small project**](https://github.com/thisismijan/LearnRust/tree/master/dev-log). With my learnings so far being:<br>  
1. installing Rust
2. cargo new/build/run
3. cargo dependencies
4. basic Rust syntax
