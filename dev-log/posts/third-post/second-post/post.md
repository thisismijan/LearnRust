#Rudimentary Plan for Adaptive Chess

I have created a [project](https://github.com/users/thisismijan/projects/1/views/1) onn github and started to create some issues to give me a bit of structure and route for building the adaptive chess application.

So far it is to create a basic chess application where the user can see a chess board gui, start a game and move pieces until the end of a game. The end goal for this stage of the project should include valid move restriction on pieces and all of the chess rules i.e. check, checkmate, en passant, castling and pawn promotion. Hopefully i'm not missing anything.

Let's see how this goes
