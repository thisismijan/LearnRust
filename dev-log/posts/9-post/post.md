# Using ChatGPT to solve the problem

<br>  

I wanted to try and use ChatGPT to solve the day's problem. Here is the link to the prompts and how I worked the problem out. [LINK](https://chat.openai.com/share/f4af104d-f992-4f64-91ea-1876a7dc44ae)<br>  

All in all, I think it took more time to get ChatGPT to solve the problem than it would have to do it myself but it was a good exercise and I can definitely see a future where using an AI as a helping hand in programming will be the norm.

I've also added a script to automate the creation of the new posts.
